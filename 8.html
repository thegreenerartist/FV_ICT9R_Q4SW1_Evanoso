		<p>Your prize for reaching the end is hearing me ramble about the characters because oh I love them so much all of them are so unique and lovable,,, Blade was my second SSR and I swear he's my favorite but don't get me wrong I love all the characters equally... Did you know I've been having a hard time pulling for the new character Rei and I have just been so sad about it like please come home you're so hot and Eiden will be so happy to ha- *gunshots*</p>
